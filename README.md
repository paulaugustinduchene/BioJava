# BioJava ðŸ§¬ðŸ”¬ (DRAFT)

## Description
BioJava is a library that provides a set of mathematical functions and objects that are commonly used in biology, specifically in the fields of genetics and DNA manipulation. These functions include basic arithmetic operations, as well as more complex functions such as calculating DNA sequence similarity and creating DNA sequence alignments. Additionally, this library provides a set of objects that represent common data structures used in biology, such as DNA sequences and genetic maps.
